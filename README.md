## 📚 How It Works

- The **navigation links** are shown horizontally on desktop using CSS Flexbox.
- On **mobile screens**, the nav links are hidden and replaced with a **hamburger icon**.
- When the icon is clicked, JavaScript toggles the menu visibility by adding/removing an `active` class.
- The transition is smooth and mobile-first.

This project demonstrates **basic DOM manipulation**, **media queries**, and **mobile-responsive UI development**.
